			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p id="one">Human curiosity to discover and explore the unknown equally drives our attempts to expand our 
			knowledge and understand the universe (Eicher, 2005).   Thus, humankind's progression into 
			space was a collaborative effort supported by intrepid pioneers such as visionaries, 
			scientists, and scholars.  It was those types of pioneers and futurists that excited people's 
			imaginations about traveling to the stars.  Then during the cold war era, an international 
			space race started between Russia and America competing to be the first to put a person into 
			space.  Russia became first to put a man in orbit; however, America was first to land on the 
			Moon.  In light of NASA's success, the organization decided to schedule numerous expeditions 
			to space marking a new era for humankind (Price, 1996).  The exploration of space benefits 
			humanity through advancements in technological innovations, the need to colonize space and 
			the cross-cultural impact on society.</p>

			The human benefits of space-based technology have left its footprint on Earth as well as the 
			solar system, from satellites and telerobotic space probes to composite golf clubs and plastic 
			bags.  Moreover, humanity's exploration of space has, as a result, advanced the development of 
			technological innovations that people use every day, such as, cellular phones, digital video 
			DivX players, smoke detectors, and Global Positioning System (GPS) Navigators (Eicher, 2005). 
			Furthermore, the International Space Station (ISS) and its crew carry out Earth observation 
			and disaster assistance.  The ISS crew obtains data from onboard sensors and imagery and Earth 
			observation satellites to provide accurate atmospheric, geological and meteorological 
			information of affected regions (NASA; NASA, International, 2013).  As a result, the 
			technology developed from the space program has changed and revolutionized the way people 
			communicate, navigate, manage and maintain their lives.

			Space colonization is advantageous to humanity and its survival in the wake of a potential 
			global catastrophe and at the same time expanding humankind's capabilities.  Though Earth is in 
			no imminent global threat, numerous occurrences in space, such as a meteorite or a massive sun 
			flare could wipe out all life.  Therefore, as a species, we should commence with the colonizing 
			of space and discover a hospitable planet for a relocation point.  In effect, those efforts will 
			help to develop alternative means of interstellar space travel and provide the critical knowledge 
			needed for Earth's expansion into space (Johnson, 2012).  <blockquote><cite>Stephen Hawking</cite> stated, "I do not think 
			the human race will survive the next thousand years unless we spread into space.  There are too 
			many accidents that can befall life on a single planet" (The EU and space, 2009, para. 8).</blockquote>		
		  <p style="text-align:left;">Overall, colonizing the solar system provides human-based interests that will help in solving 
			fundamental scientific questions concerning the formation of the solar system as well as contribute 
			to developing humanities continued space exploration and colonization efforts.

			<h2>The Human Benefits of Space exploration On Our Culture</h2>
			<p id="four"><img id="img2" src="images/The Thing.jpg" title="A photo of the science fiction movie The Thing" width="200" height="300">
			<p style="margin-top:60px;">
			Space exploration benefits humanity by its cross-cultural impact on society through musical 
			compositions, science fiction cinemas, space camps, and UFO research.  Several musicians have used 
			space travel as subject matter in the creation of lyrics for songs, and videos such as <b>Pink Floyd's</b> 
			<cite>Dark Side of the Moon</cite> or <b>David Bowie's</b> <cite>Space Oddity</cite>.  Moreover, science fiction evolved 
			into a pop-culture all of its own as a result of innovative features used in films like <b>Frank Herbert's</b> 
			<cite>Dune</cite>, or <b>Gene Roddenberry's</b> <cite>Star Trek</cite> (McLeod, 2003).   Plus, if someone wanted a 
			chance to feel like an astronaut, he or she could attend a space camp to experience different aspects of the astronauts 
			training.  On the other hand, there is a little city in <b>New Mexico</b> named <b>Roswell</b> where UFO incidents 
			have occurred.  Also located there is a <b>UFO Research Center</b> for the cataloging, archiving, and study 
			of reported close encounters (Explore space from earth, 2013).  All things considered, humankindâ€™s 
			space exploration projects have influenced people's aspirations, inventiveness, and imaginations in 
			how people define themselves in various aspects of life.</p></p>

			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>Human research expeditions to space have benefited our efforts towards expanding our diverse 
			understanding of science and fellowship in many areas.  Since the space program started, a plethora 
			of technological innovations was discovered and can be noticed almost anyplace.  Also, yet most 
			people do not know about them.  By placing colonies in space, we can improve the continuation of 
			human civilization through exploration and better understand cosmic phenomena.  When a person thinks 
			of <b>"Flash Gordon"</b> or how far back science fiction stretches, as a whole, the cultural influence can 
			be seen on a generational level that has touched countless people.  The exploration of space has 
			yielded astonishing feats and also improved people's lives because of the effort of pioneers and 
			visionaries who saw space the way we see it now.</p><br><br>
