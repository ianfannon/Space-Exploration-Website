<h1>Background Every Web Developer Needs to Know</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>In this article I'll describe the World Wide Web from a high level 
perspective, focusing on how a web page is request and delivered from a 
web server to a web browser.  Then, I want to talk about web browsers,
how they interpret the HTML you write, differences between browsers, what
are standards and to paraphrase the old joke "if Standards are so great,
why are there so many of them?"  Finally, I'll talk about the thought
process behind HTML% and CSS3, why they were introduced and what they
hope to achieve.</p>

<h2>A Brief Technical Overview of the World Wide Web</h2>

<p>The World Wide Web started out as a means for sharing scientific
resources like research documentation between govermental and academic
institutions,  It took time for the technologies and practices to evolve
beyond its original purpose.</p>

<p>From a technical perspective, the World Wide Web is comprised of 
several technologies ... first, it involves a simple markup (the Hyper-
text Markup Language, or HTML) to both structure and format textual
information.  When first introduced its claim to fame was the hyperlink 
which allowed the publisher of a document to add a link to other research
papers available from accross the world, Creating a virtual web of 
information (thus, the name).  Second, on or more interlinked pages are 
published to a server that is connected to an open network which we know
today as the Internet.</p>

<p>A protocol was devised that specialized in allowing a 
request/response-style communication between two computers.  In other 
words, one uuser requests a document by typing an address for a document 
into a special program called a web browser, and the web browser packages
up that request and sends it out into the network.  The request takes the 
form of a specially formatted packet of data.  You can think of this 
packet of information like a self-addressed stamped envelope --
containing both the address of the information requested and the address
where that information should be sent back to.  This specially formatted 
packet is known as Hyper-text Transfer Protocol, or rather, HTTP, and for 
simplicity's sake you can think of it merely as an electronic envelope.  
See Figure 1 for the types of information sent in the HTTP Request and 
Http Response messages.</p>

<figure>
  <ing src="http-message.gif" alt="A diagram of the parts of an HTTP Message">
<figcaption>Figure 1.  The HTTP Request and Response messages contains important 
information that allows communication back and forth between the client 
and the server.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The HTTP request message is routed through a series of networks wires 
and routers (i.e., devices that know how to forward HTTP messages closer
to their destination) spanning the globe using (ideally) the shortest 
route possible until it arrives at its destination, the web server at the 
address the requestor typed into the web browser.  The web server 
responds to the request by locating the requested document or resource
(in the figure, the index.html file), packaging it up using the same HTTP
style envelope, then sending the requested document back on to the network.  
The connection would only take a fraction of a second and once the computer 
served up the request, it would not retain any information about that request 
in its memory.  See Figure 2 for a diagram of interactivity between the client
and server computers.</p>

<figure>
  <ing src="www-diagram.gif" alt="A diagram of route from the user request to the web server and 
back again">
  <figcaption>Figure 2.  (1) The HTTP Reques is (2) routed across the internet to 
the (3) server which serves the (4) requested file back in the body of an HTTP 
Response message.  (5) The HTTP Response is routed across the internet to the 
original requestor.  (6) The requested file is parsed and displayed in the user's 
web browser.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Once the requested document is delivered through the netowrk back to requestor, 
that document is loaded into the web browser.  The browser parses through the HTML 
and decides how to render (or rather, display) its content and appearance on the 
computer screen.</p>

<h3>What Are Domain Names?</h3>

<p>The request that users type into web browsers originally looked something 
like this:<br>
<br>
http://157.123.23.44/index.htm</p>

<p>Why the series of numbers? Each computer on this network was assigned an address, 
called an Internet Protocol Address, or IP Address.  This was assigned through a 
lower-level protocol called Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, or rather, 
TCP/IP.  It was the foundational technology that allowed requests to be routed to the 
appropriate server that contained a given resource, or rather, web page.  However, 
because the IP address for a computer would change occasionally for a given computer or 
institution, they devised a system called the Domain Name System, or rather, the DNS, to 
turn a friendly name like:<br>
<br>
mit.edu<br> 
<br>
... into the actual "location", like:<br>
<br>
18.72.0.3.</p>

<p>A system of top-level Domain Names was created ... .deu for educational institutions, 
.mil for Military, .gov for Government, .net for Network related resources, .org for 
Non-profit organizations, .com for Commercial organizations, etc.  Later, other countries 
and a plethora of top-level domains were added and others for commercial and other 
interests.</p>  

<p>More recently, these two responsibilities - of structure and presentation - have been
split in two ... HTML should define the structure of the document, and Cascading Style 
Sheets should control the presentation, or rather, the style or aesthetic quantities of a 
web page.  We'll see how this separation of responsibilities plays out throughout this 
course.</p>

<p>One final topic I want to talk about that affects modern web development is the 
implementations of various web browsers.  As you'll recall, once the requested web page has 
been returned, it will be parsed by a web browser then displayed on screen.</p>

<ol>
<li>First of all, hopefully you now have an answer to the question 
everyone
first starting ou asks: "why the heck did they make URLs so convoluted?
Wouldn't it be easier to just type in 'microsoft' instead of 
'http://www.microsoft.com'?"  There's an evolution of technologies, and 
furthermore, it was never intended for use by the masses.  At some point
commercialized and individual access to the internet dwarfed the intended
use, however the technologies created 30 years ago are still in 
play.</li>

<li>Second, hopefully you will begin see the purpose of things like http://
... in which you are saying you want to access a specific channel of 
traffic, HTTP, or rather, World Wide Web traffic, as opposed to FTP (File
Transfer Protocol) for working with large files, SMTP (Simple Mail
Transfer Protocol) for sending email, and so on.</li>

<li>Third, hopefully you see the purpose of .com, .edu, .net and so on ... at 
least, you understand the original purpose, and you understand how those 
domain names are translated into the actual IP Addresses that are 
utilized by routers to move traffic around the internet to it's intended 
destination.</li>
</ol>

<h2>One Final Note About Our Overview</h2>

<article>

<h1>How Web Browsers Parse HTML</h1>

<ul>
<li>Trident, the web browser engine from Internet Explorer, is used by many
applications on the Microsoft Windows platform, such as netSmart, Outlook 
Express, some versions of Microsoft Outlook, and the mini-browsers in 
Winamp and RealPlayer.</li>

<li>KDE's open-source KHTML engine is used in KDE's Konqueror web browser and 
was the basis for WebKit, the rendering engine in Apple's Safari and 
Google's Chrome web browsers.</li>

<li>Gecko, the Mozilla project's open-source web browser engine, is used by a
variety of products derived from the Mozilla code base, including the Firefox 
web browser, the Thunderbird e-mail client, and SeaMonkey internet suite.</li>
</ul> 

<asideThere are four majar parsing and rendering engines that are popular today.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Hopefully you can see the issues surrounding HTML% and CSS3 with regards to their 
support by various versions and vendors of web browsers and two different thought
processes on how to incorporate HTML% into your own work.</aside>
